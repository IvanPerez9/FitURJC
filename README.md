* __Configuration Instructions:__
  * Description: Spring Framework provides several data access methods, we use data access via JPA to a MySQL database using    Hibernate.
First we create the project, modifying the pom.xml file so that it contains the dependencies and configurations for JPA and MySQL.

    To indicate to Spring how to access the Database, we need to create the configuration file: application.properties located in src / main / resources.

    We have to create a JPA entity, making a relationship with a relational database. Using the CrudRepository interface we can delete, create, edit or search elements in our data set.
    We add the main class in the MySQL database.

* __[Relative reference to Angular Diagrams Folder](https://github.com/IvanPerez9/FitURJC/tree/master/angular/diagrams)__

* __Preparation of the development enviroment:__
  * Description: For installation we must have Node and Npm installed on the computer.
    Once npm is installed, we execute the following command in the terminal of the equipment:


    		npm install -g @angular/cli


    We will be able to install Angular cli globally in our team. Angular cli is the Angular console tool that will help us in programming. To create a project, we write:


    		ng new name_app


    Access in the terminal to the folder that we just created and execute:


    		npm install


    With this command we install the necessary dependencies in the project. Finally, to run the web application: 


    		ng serve --open


    By default, Angular runs on port 4200
